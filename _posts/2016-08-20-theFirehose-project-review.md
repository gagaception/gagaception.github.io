<h2><b>Sometimes you need to make one step to change your hole life.</b></h2>

When I started the Firehose project bootcamp I didn’t know how it will all end after 12 weeks of coding.

There were lots of difficulties such as huge difference in timezone, luck of coding knowledge and practice at the beginning, and general it was scary to try something new. But anyway I decided to try it, and it was super interesting during all 12 weeks.

And now after over 1 year of graduation from the Firehose Project and 8 month working as PHP developer I’m really thankful to Marco, Ken, Frederick - my personal mentor, Travis - our team mentor and to all my teammates: Jonathan, Takehiro, Adam and Ronny.

This 12 weeks in the Firehose Project gave me more coding and life experience than 4 years in university. By the way about my background before the Firehose Project - my speciality is «Automation and Control» and I worked as an engineer in local company. Being an engineer might be interesting too, but it wasn’t my dream job.

I don’t want to repeat others the Firehose Project students reviews about want you will learn, you can always check the curriculum there <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com">theFireHose Project</a>. I just want to mention most valuable lessons that I have learned during my education:
<ol>
	<li>You will learn how to find right solution own your own. Googling is our everything, but don’t forget to spent time for reading code and understanding it. Don’t just copy and paste.</li><br>
	<li>During your mentor session you will learn how to ask RIGHT QUESTIONS to your Senior mentor - it’s very important skill for Junior Developer.</li><br>
	<li>You will be more responsible for what you are writing. You can’t write code as you wish - you are part of the team and you have to follow the rules, otherwise someone will spent his time to correct your code. And it is not cool … Group project is super interesting, especially if you will spend it practicing pair programming with your teammates. Spend as much time as you can practicing it - you will learn something new from them and you can always share you knowledge and experience with them.</li><br>
	<li>There is always something to strive for: the uniqueness of been web - developer is that there lots of ways where you can find yourself, there lots of new staff appears everyday, lots of programming languages, frameworks and you can always learn something new.</li><br>
	<li>the Firehose Project is your first step to web - dev. If you spent enough time on practicing you will have good results. You have to clearly understand that you need a time and practice to become Middle or Senior Developer, there is a lot of things that you don’t know, but it is ok, don’t panic just continue moving forward.</li>
</ol>

Now about how I started my carrier as a web - developer. As told earlier, I was looking for my dream job. Dream job is not just what you are doing everyday, but also people, who works this you, general atmosphere in office. Lots of factors influence on your attitude to your job and it’s very important to find people who are also passionated about what they are doing.

In my case, after graduation from the Firehose project, I spend 2 month searching for job, it might sound not very optimistic, but in our reality there are lots of developer without any real experience (same was I and maybe you) and if you want to be noticed you have to understand this fact and start think different while you are in search of job. Be honest with yourself about your coding skills, don’t embellish them in your CV. I was interviewed more than 40 times. Of course it is not very pleasant to hear refusal, but you have to find profit even from them. I was asked lots of questions, the answers to which I didn’t know, but after each interview I spent time searching for answers. In my CV I wrote about my coding journey with the Firehose Project, I wrote that i super passionate about programming and ready to start working as trainee.

<b>It is not the question about money when you start your carrier as a programer.</b>

I was honest with my future employer and he saw my serious mood to become cool web - developer. And now I’m working in one of the best company in Kazakhstan, with great colleagues. After few month Senior - developer - his name is Alex, who was checking CVs told me that he insisted on that I was accepted to work, because from 150 CVs I was only one who told the truth about programming skills and did something in the beginning of my carrier (participated in the Firehose Project bootcamp) and he saw my serious attitude and my passion. By the way, now he is my good friend and my mentor. With his help I found out about local coding community and now I’m participating in all meet-ups and conference.

Even now I understand how much I don’t know, but it will be super interesting journey.

Again, I want to give thanks to Marko and Ken - for creating such great community, Frederick - for sharing his experience with me, my teammates and our mentor Travis - for helping and support and also for being good team.
